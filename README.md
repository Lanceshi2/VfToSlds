Sample code for transferring Visualforce tags into SLDS look and feel

This repository contains the sample code for transferring a series of <apex:xxx> tags in Visualforce into Lightning look and feel. The pages are named after the <apex:xxx> tags. For example, the sample code for transferring <apex:sectionHeader> is at page/SectionHeader. 

All the code in this repository is ready to use in every developer org. For the third party Javascript library, I have used Appiphony JS. 

I believe most pages can be easily converted into a Visualforce component. I didn't do some because I want to leave more flexibility to you. But feel free to convert it into Visualforce component if you want.
